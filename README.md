* We're currently considering setting up the skeleton of the framework. What you are currently looking at is "orbital-core". This will house rendering, entity, bundling/packaging and networking logic as well as some asset/screen resizing features. Everything beyond this is going to be part of a plugin initiative where developers will be able to pick and choose what they want, or make their own. 

* We currently have no plans to support 3-D rendering, although once the plugin system comes about and we have a solid amount of plugins available to developers it may be something we look at.

* Our goal is create a framework that makes creating a client/server architecture to be painless, quick, and most importantly fun. Whether it be for a game that is 99% client side and only needs server for chat or high scores, to a 2-D Browser MMO, our goal is the make Orbital the ideal choice.
